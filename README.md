## Future of Development
#### Planned for Next Patch (Excl. Hotfix Patches)
* Changes to Damage System (Adjust Bullet Damage, Knockouts, Revive System??). Aims to stop "Weak" rounds such as 9mm, 5.56mm etc from doing next to nothing
* Crate Loading (Load Mission and Loot Crates in to Vehicles)

#### Planned for a Future Patch
* High PVP & Loot Zone (Loot is Much Better and Spawn Rate Increased. XP for Player Kills Increased, other minor buffs)
* Base Painting (If Possible with Epoch Assets)

#### Just Ideas
* Placable Prefab Objects
* Client-Side Objects (Need More Data on Server Performance Under Load)
* Performance Optimisations (Dynamic Loading of Objects, Unload Objects Not in Line-of-Sight, etc)
